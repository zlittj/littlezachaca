App Idea:

Weather Notification app: this app would have a weather map, as well as a system that notifies the user if it's going to rain or be cold. The basic idea is
most weather apps are overly complicated/ and make you make too many decisions. For example. My current weather app tells me the temp/percent chance of rain.
But I want my app to tell me to "Grab an Umbrella today!" or "Grab your jacket, it's gonna be cold outside!"
It would be location based, and there would be selectors for what temps/percent chances of rain would cause the notifications to activate.


OR

Birding Life list app. It's basically a checklist app, but for people who keep a birding checklist. Probably have some syncing or downloading capabilities.
Maybe support import of users photos, and users data into the app.
